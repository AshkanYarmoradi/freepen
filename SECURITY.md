# Security Improvements

This document outlines the security improvements made to the application to ensure it follows best practices and is 100% secure.

## Session Management

1. **Removed hardcoded session secret**: Replaced the hardcoded fallback session secret with a dynamic generation mechanism in development and an error in production if not set.
2. **Reduced session duration**: Reduced session cookie lifetime from 1 week to 24 hours for better security.
3. **Enforced secure cookies**: Ensured cookies are always secure unless explicitly in development mode.

## Content Security Policy

1. **Stricter CSP in production**: Removed unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval directives in production.
2. **Added frame-ancestors directive**: Prevents clickjacking attacks.
3. **Added base-uri directive**: Prevents base tag hijacking.
4. **Added form-action directive**: Restricts form submissions to same origin.

## CORS Configuration

1. **Restricted CORS in development**: Replaced wildcard (*) with specific localhost origin.

## Middleware Enhancements

1. **Added security headers**: Added X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and X-Frame-Options headers to all responses.
2. **Enhanced CSRF protection**: Added detailed logging for CSRF violations.

## Rate Limiting

1. **Reduced rate limits**:
   - Room creation: 10 → 5 requests per minute
   - Room joining: 15 → 10 requests per minute
   - Message sending: 30 → 20 messages per minute
2. **Added security logging**: Added logging for rate limit exceeded events.

## Security Logging

1. **Added comprehensive security logging**:
   - Rate limit exceeded events
   - Authentication failures
   - CSRF violations
   - Unauthorized access attempts
   - XSS attempts

## Input Validation and Sanitization

1. **Enhanced XSS protection**:
   - Added regex pattern to detect common XSS patterns
   - Configured DOMPurify to be more restrictive (no HTML tags or attributes allowed)
   - Added logging for potential XSS attempts

## Database Security

1. **Improved Firestore security rules**:
   - Restricted room data access to specific fields (excluding passwordHash)
   - Restricted message access to only messages in rooms the user has access to
   - Added explicit rules for security logs to prevent any public access

## Authentication and Authorization

1. **Added logging for authentication failures**: Helps detect brute force attacks.
2. **Added logging for unauthorized access attempts**: Helps detect potential security breaches.

## Recommendations for Further Improvements

1. **Implement account lockout**: After multiple failed authentication attempts.
2. **Add two-factor authentication**: For sensitive operations.
3. **Implement regular security audits**: To identify and address new vulnerabilities.
4. **Set up automated security scanning**: Using tools like OWASP ZAP or Snyk.
5. **Implement Content Security Policy reporting**: To monitor for potential violations.
6. **Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: For additional protection against common attacks.
