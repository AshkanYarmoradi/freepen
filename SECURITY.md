# Security Documentation

This document provides comprehensive information about the security features, practices, and improvements implemented in the freepen application. Security is a top priority for our chat application to ensure user privacy and data protection.

## Security Architecture

### Overview

The freepen application implements a multi-layered security approach:

1. **Authentication Layer**: Handles user identity verification
2. **Session Management Layer**: Maintains secure user sessions
3. **Authorization Layer**: Controls access to resources
4. **Input Validation Layer**: Ensures data integrity and prevents injection attacks
5. **Rate Limiting Layer**: Protects against abuse and DoS attacks
6. **Logging Layer**: Records security events for monitoring and auditing
7. **Network Security Layer**: Implements secure communication protocols
8. **Database Security Layer**: Enforces data access controls

### Security Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security controls at different layers
- **Least Privilege**: Users and processes have minimal necessary access
- **Secure by Default**: Security features enabled by default
- **Fail Securely**: Errors don't compromise security
- **Complete Mediation**: All access attempts are verified
- **Separation of Duties**: Critical operations require multiple steps

## Authentication and Authorization

### User Authentication

- Firebase Authentication for secure user identity verification
- Email/password authentication with strong password requirements
- Session-based authentication using Iron Session
- CSRF protection on all authenticated routes

### Room Authentication

- Secure password hashing using PBKDF2 with:
  - 100,000 iterations (industry-recommended)
  - 64-byte key length
  - SHA-512 hashing algorithm
- Constant-time password comparison to prevent timing attacks
- Room-specific authentication tokens stored in encrypted session

### Authorization Controls

- Route-level authorization checks for all protected resources
- Firebase security rules for database-level authorization
- Room membership verification for all message operations
- Explicit deny-by-default access control

## Session Management

1. **Secure Session Configuration**:
   - Removed hardcoded session secret in favor of environment variable
   - Dynamic secret generation in development with error in production if not set
   - Reduced session cookie lifetime from 1 week to 24 hours
   - Enforced secure cookies in all environments except explicit development mode
   - HTTP-only cookies to prevent JavaScript access
   - SameSite=Lax cookie attribute to prevent CSRF

2. **Session Validation**:
   - Cryptographic verification of session integrity
   - User session validation on every protected request
   - Automatic session termination on security violations

## Content Security

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

1. **Production CSP Configuration**:
   - Removed unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval directives
   - Strict source restrictions for scripts, styles, and media
   - Added frame-ancestors directive to prevent clickjacking
   - Added base-uri directive to prevent base tag hijacking
   - Added form-action directive to restrict form submissions

2. **Development CSP Configuration**:
   - Relaxed for development tools while maintaining security
   - Clear warnings for unsafe practices

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

- Restricted CORS in all environments
- Replaced wildcard (*) with specific origins
- Proper handling of preflight requests
- Limited exposed headers

### Security Headers

- **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block**: Additional XSS protection
- **X-Frame-Options: DENY**: Prevents framing (clickjacking protection)
- **Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin**: Limits referrer information
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts browser features

## Input Validation and Sanitization

### Form Validation

- Zod schema validation for all user inputs
- Strong typing with TypeScript
- Server-side validation regardless of client validation

### XSS Protection

- DOMPurify configuration:
  - No HTML tags or attributes allowed
  - Strict sanitization of all user-generated content
- Regex pattern detection for common XSS patterns
- Content-Security-Policy as defense-in-depth
- Proper output encoding in all contexts

### Injection Prevention

- Parameterized queries for database operations
- Firebase SDK provides protection against NoSQL injection
- Validation of all IDs and parameters

## Rate Limiting

### Implemented Limits

- **Room Creation**: 5 requests per minute (reduced from 10)
- **Room Joining**: 10 requests per minute (reduced from 15)
- **Message Sending**: 20 messages per minute (reduced from 30)
- **Authentication Attempts**: 5 attempts per minute

### Rate Limit Implementation

- Token bucket algorithm for fair rate limiting
- IP-based rate limiting with provisions for proxies
- User-based rate limiting for authenticated requests
- Configurable via environment variables
- Graceful degradation during limit exceeded events

## Security Logging and Monitoring

### Event Logging

- Comprehensive security event logging:
  - Rate limit exceeded events
  - Authentication failures
  - CSRF violations
  - Unauthorized access attempts
  - XSS attempts
  - Session tampering
  - Input validation failures

### Log Format

- Structured logging with consistent format
- Includes timestamp, event type, severity, user ID (if available), IP address, and event details
- PII redaction in logs
- Secure storage of logs

### Monitoring

- Real-time alerts for critical security events
- Aggregated security metrics
- Anomaly detection for unusual patterns

## Database Security

### Firestore Security Rules

- **Room Access Control**:
  - Read access limited to authenticated users
  - Create access limited to authenticated users
  - Update/delete limited to room owners
  - Field-level security (passwordHash not exposed)

- **Message Access Control**:
  - Read access limited to room members
  - Create access limited to room members
  - Update/delete limited to message authors

- **Room Membership Control**:
  - Read access limited to authenticated users
  - Create access limited to authenticated users with proper room authentication
  - Membership ID validation to prevent spoofing

- **Security Logs**:
  - No public access (read/write: false)
  - Only accessible via Firebase Admin SDK

### Data Protection

- No sensitive data stored in client-accessible storage
- Encrypted passwords with strong hashing
- Minimal data collection principle

## Network Security

- HTTPS enforced for all communications
- Secure WebSocket connections for real-time messaging
- HTTP/2 for improved performance and security
- TLS 1.2+ required

## Security Testing

- Regular security testing methodology:
  - Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
  - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
  - Dependency scanning
  - Manual penetration testing

## Incident Response

- Defined security incident response process:
  1. Identification
  2. Containment
  3. Eradication
  4. Recovery
  5. Lessons learned
- Clear roles and responsibilities
- Communication plan for security incidents
