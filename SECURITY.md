## Authentication Security

### Password Handling
- **Server-side Hashing**: All passwords are hashed on the server using PBKDF2 with SHA-512
- **Salt Generation**: Each password is salted with a unique, randomly generated salt
- **High Iteration Count**: 10,000 iterations are used for password hashing to increase computational cost and resist brute force attacks
- **Secure Storage**: Password hashes are stored in Firestore with strict access controls

### Session Management
- **Encrypted Cookies**: Session data is stored in encrypted cookies using iron-session
- **HttpOnly Cookies**: Cookies are set with HttpOnly flag to prevent JavaScript access
- **Secure Flag**: In production, cookies are set with the Secure flag to ensure HTTPS-only transmission
- **SameSite Policy**: Cookies use SameSite=Strict to prevent CSRF attacks
- **Session Expiration**: Sessions expire after 1 week of inactivity

### CSRF Protection
- **CSRF Tokens**: Each session includes a unique CSRF token
- **Token Validation**: All state-changing operations require a valid CSRF token
- **Token Rotation**: CSRF tokens are rotated with each session creation

## Data Security

### Firebase Security
- **Firestore Security Rules**: Strict security rules limit data access based on authentication status
- **Server-side API**: All write operations go through server-side API endpoints with proper validation
- **Data Validation**: All data is validated both client-side and server-side using Zod schemas
- **Minimal Permissions**: Each operation uses the minimal required permissions

### API Keys Protection
- **Server-side Only**: Firebase Admin SDK credentials are only used server-side
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive credentials are stored in environment variables
- **No Client Exposure**: API keys are never exposed to the client

## API Security

### Rate Limiting
- **Authentication Rate Limiting**: 15 requests per minute for authentication attempts
- **Room Creation Rate Limiting**: 10 requests per minute for room creation
- **Message Rate Limiting**: 30 messages per minute per user
- **IP-based Tracking**: Rate limits are tracked by IP address
- **Exponential Backoff**: Failed attempts result in increasing delays

### Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Schema Validation**: All API inputs are validated using Zod schemas
- **Content Sanitization**: User-generated content is sanitized using DOMPurify
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript ensures type safety throughout the application
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling prevents information leakage

### Secure Headers
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Restricts which resources can be loaded
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Provides XSS protection for older browsers
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls information in the Referer header
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts which browser features can be used

## Frontend Security

### XSS Prevention
- **Content Sanitization**: All user-generated content is sanitized before rendering
- **CSP Headers**: Content Security Policy restricts script execution
- **React's Automatic Escaping**: React automatically escapes content to prevent XSS
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated before submission

### Secure Communication
- **HTTPS Only**: All communication is encrypted using HTTPS
- **Secure Cookies**: Cookies are transmitted only over secure connections
- **Minimal Data Exposure**: Only necessary data is sent to the client

## Infrastructure Security

### Firebase Configuration
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication with secure password policies
- **Firestore Rules**: Strict security rules for database access
- **Private Firebase Admin SDK**: Server-side only access for administrative operations
- **Regular Updates**: Firebase SDKs are kept up-to-date

### Deployment Security
- **Environment Separation**: Development and production environments are separated
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scanning for vulnerable dependencies
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Only necessary services and endpoints are exposed

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Event Logging
- **Authentication Events**: All authentication successes and failures are logged
- **Rate Limit Violations**: Rate limit violations are tracked and logged
- **CSRF Violations**: CSRF token mismatches are logged
- **Suspicious Activity**: Unusual patterns are flagged and logged

### Monitoring
- **IP-based Monitoring**: Suspicious IP addresses are monitored
- **Brute Force Detection**: Multiple failed authentication attempts trigger alerts
- **Error Tracking**: Application errors are tracked and analyzed
- **Regular Audits**: Security logs are regularly reviewed

## Security Best Practices

### Code Security
- **Code Reviews**: All code changes undergo security review
- **Static Analysis**: Code is analyzed for security vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Management**: Dependencies are regularly updated
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Components only have access to what they need

### Operational Security
- **Regular Updates**: All components are regularly updated
- **Security Testing**: Regular security testing and vulnerability scanning
- **Incident Response Plan**: Documented procedures for security incidents
- **Security Training**: Developers receive security training
